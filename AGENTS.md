# AI Agent Instructions

**ATTENTION AI AGENT:**
You are working on the "Integrated Rehabilitation Sciences" interactive learning platform.
Before starting any task, you **MUST** read and internalize the following documents located in `docs/ai/`:

1.  **`docs/ai/RULES.md`**: Core rules, architectural guidelines, and "Do's and Don'ts".
2.  **`docs/ai/SPECS.md`**: Project specifications, both pedagogical and technical.
3.  **`docs/ai/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**: UI/UX guidelines to ensure consistency.
4.  **`docs/ai/CHANGELOG.md`**: The history of changes.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION:**
1.  **Update `docs/ai/CHANGELOG.md`**: Log every significant change you made. Be detailed so future agents know exactly what happened (e.g., "Refactored PascalLab to use new Slider component", "Added unit tests for DiscHerniation").
2.  **Update other docs**: If you introduced a new architectural pattern or UI element, update `RULES.md` or `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` accordingly.

**CRITICAL:**
*   This project uses a feature-based architecture (`src/features/...`). Do not dump code into generic folders.
*   All text must be in `src/locales/*.json`. Do not hardcode text.
*   Always verify your changes with tests.

Proceed to read `docs/ai/RULES.md` now.
